# RStuff
This repository contains my notable R projects from a couple of different course


The first file titled "AppliedEconometrics" contains my project partner and I's final research project for our Applied Econometrics course. We were asked to find and isolate some causality trend to the best of our ability with the advanced econometric theory and metrics we learned from lecture. The file contains the specfic data sets we used, the R code itself, and the write up. 


The second file titled "DataVisualization" contains my group's final project for our Data Visualization course. The point of this course was to learn different ways to visualize data to draw meaningful conclusions. This file contains the R code itself which covers the the Data Set we used. It also contains extensive comments referring to the code as well as explaining what each code segement means. Our ppt presentation is also included with the screenshots of the coded graphs.
